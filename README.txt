Invisible Inc Pilots 1.0
Art and Concept By: Hekateras
Code By: NamesAreHard

In the ultimate crossover, Invisible Inc Agents join the pilot pool.
Note: Everything should work in missions, but Sharp specifically doesn't always work in test mech and tooltips because if its reliance on save data

Internationale: Grants all buildings a temporary shield before attacking, and removes them after.
Tony Xu: "Replace repair with a 1 damage electric whip attack with building chain. -1 move on turn one."
Sharp: Replace Repair with a melee punch that does 1 + (cores/3) damage.

TODO:
CEO Reskin - Not sure how to do this
Better Sharp Damage Storage: I don't think this is doable
